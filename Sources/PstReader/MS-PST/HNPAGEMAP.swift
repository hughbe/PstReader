/// [MS-PST] 2.3.1 HN (Heap-on-Node)
/// The Heap-on-Node defines a standard heap over a node's data stream. Taking advantage of the
/// flexible structure of the node, the organization of the heap data can take on several forms, depending
/// on how much data is stored in the heap.
/// For heaps whose size exceed the amount of data that can fit in one data block, the first data block in
/// the HN contains a full header record and a trailer record. With the exception of blocks that require an
/// HNBITMAPHDR structure, subsequent data blocks only have an abridged header and a trailer. This is
/// explained in more detail in the following sections. Because the heap is a structure that is defined at a
/// higher layer than the NDB, the heap structures are written to the external data sections of data blocks
/// and do not use any information from the data block's NDB structure.
/// [MS-PST] 2.3.1.5 HNPAGEMAP
/// The HNPAGEMAP is the last item in the variable length data portion of the block immediately
/// following the last heap item. There can be anywhere from 0 to 63 bytes of padding between the
/// HNPAGEMAP and the block trailer. The beginning of the HNPAGEMAP is aligned on a 2-byte
/// boundary so there can be an additional 1 byte of padding between the last heap item and the
/// HNPAGEMAP.
/// The HNPAGEMAP structure contains the information about the allocations in the page. The
/// HNPAGEMAP is located using the ibHnpm field in the HNHDR, HNPAGEHDR and HNBITMAPHDR
/// records.
